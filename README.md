# ImageBook Microservices

This repository contains links and documentation for the ImageBook project's microservices.

## Microservices

- [ImageBook Client](https://github.com/EgSundqvist/imagebook-client): Frontend application, built with React and TypeScript.
- [ImageBook User API](https://github.com/EgSundqvist/imagebook-userapi): API for user management, built with Python.
- [ImageBook Image API](https://github.com/EgSundqvist/imagebook-imageapi): API for image management, built with Go.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project has been to build an application according to Cloud Native.
This concept includes: Logic and functionality is divided into small Microservices instead of larger
apis and services.
Container technology such as Docker to package and isolate applications and services and optimize
use of hardware performance.
Orchestration with tools such as Kubernetes for distribution and scaling of
container-based applications.
CI/CD for continuous integration and delivery and automation of workflows and processes in
development such as Codebuild.
In addition, my purpose has also been to develop my knowledge in two previously unfamiliar
languages ​​that are commonly used for building microservices. Go and Python.

## Description and use

Imagebook - Is a web application that is intended as a private photo album.
Currently, the user can register, log in, manage account and profile, upload and delete
images and view their uploaded images in an infinite scroll. There is also a plan to build on the
application and make it more social and interactive by implementing functionality to
be able to interact with other users and view their resources.

## Client - React

The client, which is built in React, is intended to provide a clean and logical interface, where the user can manage images and their user and profile information.
React Router is used to facilitate routing and give the user a clear way to navigate
with an experience of S.P.A. React router is also used to distinguish pages with public or
protected which is determined based on the user's authentication.
JSON Web Tokens are generated by the user-api upon login. The client then sends the token back to the user-api or image-api with
each request.
LocalStorage and Redux are used to store tokens in the browser across page loads and
shutdowns and manage global state across the application such as isAuthenticated. The application uses a timer to keep track of the token's validity period and automatically logs the user out when the token is no longer valid.
Tanstack Query is used to display the user's images in an infinite scroll and provides
some caching functions.
MUI has been used to retrieve nice and functional components that in most cases have been
modified further to better fit the application.
I have tried to maintain a clear and consistent project structure through clear naming,
dividing code into components, hooks and pages to separate responsibilities, keep the file size down and to be able to reuse code.
